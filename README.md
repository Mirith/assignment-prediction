# assignment-choice
A class project that determines which assignment a student will choose given a number of variables

This uses a dataset provided by my professor called assignments.csv.  No idea if he wants that data online, so it will not be uploaded.  

The html report can be used to view the code and whatever outputs it is supposed to give with the dataset.
