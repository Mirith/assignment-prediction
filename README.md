# assignment-choice
A class project that determines which assignment a student will choose given a number of variables

This uses a dataset provided by my professor called assignments.csv. 

The html report can be used to view the code and whatever outputs it is supposed to give with the dataset, as well as some graphs, if you don't want to download the r code and run it on your machine or compile the report yourself.  

Factors given in the data were things like gender, hours a week the student studied, or number of mistakes the student made in the last exam.  It uses a CART (classification and regression tree) to determine which factors were significant predictors to the end of term assignment chosen by the student.
